	<h2>How Does it Work and What Does it do?</h2>
	<p>We want to try to replicate one of the fantasy football score calculators that are in the fantasy football apps. This fantasy Football calculator will take a dictionary as an input containing a list of a bunch of names of football players and statistics about them, and with them we plan to be able to calculate your fantasy football score for a specific player. Additionally, the more data that is provided, the more analysis we can give to show a players value compared to others. We wanted to do this project because we both share a common interest in football, and have played fantasy football in the past, wondering about how the score calculator works for each player. Because of this, we wanted to try to make one first hand and see if we could make it accurate and see if we can make it work. The program will be able to differentiate between multiple fantasy football formats and give scores for the one the user wants. It is hard to analyze data in normal fantasy football apps, so we want to create a program that can run multiple data analyses on the given players.
