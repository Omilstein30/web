    <p>The Triassic Period was period where we have found Dinosour fossils from the longest time ago, and some famous species fro this time are the Eoraptor and the Coelophysis. The Eoraptor is very important because it is the predecessor to many of the smaller predatorian therapods of the later periods, such as the Velociraptor and the Dilophosaurus </p>
