    <p>The graphs represent 4 results. Graph 1 represents the scores for the full list of fantasy football starters. Graph 2 represents the values for the full list. Graph 3 represents the scores for the list of running backs. Graph 4 represents the values for the list of running backs. Graphs 2 and 4 use our 'modify', 'acquire_color' and 'counting' functions. This regulates the ticks, changes colors based on position, and changes the labels to numbers. Changing the labels is especially important because as you can see in graphs 1 and 3, it is incredibly hard to read all the names on one graph.</p>
